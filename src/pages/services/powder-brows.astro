Unlike traditional microblading, which uses hair-like strokes, powder brows create a misty, shaded effect. This technique is ideal for clients with oily skin, mature skin, or those looking for a more polished look.</p> <p class='mb-8'> This semi-permanent technique gives your brows beautiful depth and color without harsh lines. The result? Brows that look naturally fuller, symmetrical, and are always ready—no makeup needed.</p>",
