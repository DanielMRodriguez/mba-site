  description: "<p class='mb-8'>Microshading is a semi-permanent brow technique that gives your brows a soft, powdered effect perfect for those who want fuller, defined brows without harsh edges. Often called the \"shadow brow,\" this treatment uses tiny, pin-like dots of pigment to create a gradient, filled-in look. It's ideal for clients with sensitive skin, oily skin, or anyone who prefers a polished brow appearance similar to wearing makeup, but without the daily effort.</p>",
