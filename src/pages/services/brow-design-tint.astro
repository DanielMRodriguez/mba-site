This service involves mapping and shaping your brows to perfection, then applying a tint or henna dye that stains both the skin and brow hairs for a fuller, more defined look.</p> <p class='mb-8'>Henna is a plant-based option that offers a longer-lasting skin stain compared to regular tint, while also conditioning the brow hairs for improved health and shine. Results last up to 6 weeks depending on your skin type and aftercare.</p>",
