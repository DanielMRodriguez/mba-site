Think of it as a semi-permanent brow styling—like a \"perm\" for your brows—creating the look of fuller, perfectly brushed-up eyebrows.</p> <p class='mb-8'> It's ideal for clients with unruly, thin, or downward-growing brows who want a cleaner, fuller appearance without daily styling. Results last 6-8 weeks and give your brows that effortless, laminated look you see all over social media.</p>",
